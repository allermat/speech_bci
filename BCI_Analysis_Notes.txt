		Data Collection
			- Only 5 runs were collected
			- No headpoints and the 70th EEG channel were not digitized during preparation
			- Bug in the script prevented automatic saving of behavioural data, so I had to 
				do it manually which means they need further pre-processing. 
		Pre-processing
			- EEG: rejected channels were not interpolated because of missing
				channel position and montage. Once I have a montage I can interpolated
			- MEG: no issues
